# h1 => Smart home platform Wink suffering widespread outage
# Smart home platform Wink is having a widespread outage, just over a month after it implemented a paid subscription plan for most of 
# its previously free features. First reported by Android Police, the outage appears to have started Thursday. Users started getting email 
# notices from the company on Friday apologizing for the outage, and Wink tweeted Friday afternoon that it was aware of an issue, and not
# under any kind of attack.

# We are aware of an issue impacting the Wink platform. We just wanted to let you know that we're still here, and we're not under attack. 
# Rest assured that we are working diligently to get everyone back online. All updates will continue to be shared at https://t.co/WPpNKlhbQv.
